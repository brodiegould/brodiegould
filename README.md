- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brodiegould
- Iâ€™m consumed by an interest that lies somewhere at the intersection between finance and technology
- I'm currently a 4th year student studying electrical engineering at the University of Victoria
- Future Goals: 
  - Get more exposure to more high level standard programming languages like Python, 
  - Gain a better understanding of smart contracts built on the Etherium or Solana network via Rust or Solidity
  - Create a web app that pulls updated SEC EDGAR quarterly data, and levereages existing financial API's to create an automated company analysis tool
- ðŸ“« The best way to contact me is by email, which is brodiegould1@hotmail.com
