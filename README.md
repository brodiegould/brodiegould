- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brodiegould
- Iâ€™m consumed by an interest that lies somewhere at the intersection between technology and finance
- I'm currently a 4th year student studying electrical engineering at the University of Victoria
- Future Goals: 
  - Get more exposure to more high level standard programming languages like Python, and JS 
  - Gain a better understanding of smart contracts built on the Etherium or Solana network via Rust or Solidity
